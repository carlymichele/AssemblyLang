# Programming Assignment 2

NOTE: The ONLY files that should be #included for this assignment are <iostream>, <vector>, and <string>.This assignment can be done without using the Vector class, but it is OK to use it.

#### Write a C++ program with the following functions:
* **int bin_to_dec(string s)**
    * INPUT(S): an UNsigned binary number as a string (e.g., “10110001”)
    * RETURN(S): the binary number converted to the equivalent decimal number
    * PURPOSE: Converts any UNsigned binary number to decimal
* **string dec_to_bin(int n)**
    * INPUT(s): A non-negative decimal number (e.g, 15)
    * RETURN(S): The decimal number converted to the equivalent binary number (as a string)
    * PURPOSE: Converts any non-negative decimal number to binary

* **int hex_to_dec(string s)**
    * INPUT(S): an UNsigned hexadecimal number as a string (e.g., “FABC”)
    * RETURN(S): the hexadecimal number converted to the equivalent decimal number
    * PURPOSE: Converts any UNsigned hexadecimal number to decimal

* **string dec_to_hex(int n)**
    * INPUT(s): A non-negative decimal number (e.g, 15)
    * RETURN(S): The decimal number converted to the equivalent hexadecimal number (as a string)
    * PURPOSE: Converts any non-negative decimal number to hexadecimal
